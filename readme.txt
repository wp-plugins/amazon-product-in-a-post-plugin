Quickly add formatted Amazon Products to post/page by using just the Amazon ASIN (ISBN-10). Great for monetizing your posts.
== Description ==
Amazon Product In a Post Plugin is used to to quickly add a formatted Amazon Product/Item to a post or page by using just the Amazon product ASIN (also known as the ISBN-10).

What can you use it for? With this plugin you can:

* Add any Amazon product or item to an existing Post (or Page).
* Monetize your blog posts with custom Amazon Product and add your own Reviews, descriptions or any other thing you would normally want to add to a post - and still have the Amazon product there.
* Easily add only the items that are right for your site.
* Add the product to the TOP of the post content, the BOTTOM of the post content, or make the post content become part of the product layout (see screenshots for examples)

If you have an Amazon Affiliate account and you don't think the available Amazon widgets are that great or are what you need, then this plugin might be for you.

**How it Works:**
The plugin uses the newly revised (and re-named) Amazon Product Advertising API. Older plugins that use Old API calls will no longer work as of 8/2009 because Amazon implemented a new security call procedure that makes many of them obsolete.

To use the plugin, you must have an Amazon Affiliate Account. You can sign up [here](http://amazon.com "amazon") if you do not have one - it is free and pretty easy to do. Once you have an account, install the plugin, then enter your Amazon Associate ID in the plugin options page. You are now ready to start adding products to your post!

*PLEASE NOTE:* If you DO NOT add your own custom Associate ID, you WILL NOT get credit for any purchases made from your product posts - so don't set up products on a live site unless you enter that first - or you may lose out on some referral $$. You have been warned!


== Installation ==
After you intall the plugin, you need to set up your Amazon Affiliate/Associate ID in the Options panel located in the AMAZON PIP menu under AMAZON PIP OPTIONS. 

No additional adjustments are needed unless you want to configure your own CSS styles. Styles can be adjusted or removed in the OPtions Panel as well.

*WARNING: If you do not add your Amazon Affiliate ID, you will NOT get credit for purchases made using this Plugin.*

**Adding products is a simple process.**

To Add a product to an existing post:
*  Go into the full edit mode for the post (Post/Edit then select the post).
*  Under the Content editor, there will be a box called Amazon Product In a Post Settings. Maximize it if it is not already fully visible.
*  There are 3sections to fill out, Active, Location and ASIN.
*  If Active is checked, the product will be live if the post is published.
*  For the Location, pick the spot you want the product to show.
*  Then enter the ASIN in the ASIN field.
*  Save or Publish the post.

To Add a New Product Post, you have 2 options:
* You can add a new post the regular way (Post / Add New / fill out the items /Publish), and them add the product as outlined above
* Or you can use the Quick Add Product Feature (called Amazon PIP in the Amazon PIP menu). This is the fastest method for adding a quick product with minimum text. This Method will create a New Post in the selected categories.
