Version info:
3.5.1	Basic template integration (for future use - or if you are good at hooks and filters and can figure it out on your own - go ahead - the structure is there!)
	Removed traces of Developer Keys at Amazon's request.
	Added Amazon Elements shortcode to add bits and pieces of a product to a post - very hady for making a custom layout.
	Added Amazon Cache Viewer - allows you to manually delete a product cache to initate a new amazon Call. Caches are stored for 60 minutes and updated as the calls are needed.
	Added Getting Started page to help users set up affiliate and API Key signup. This is becoming more and more complex, so a little help was needed.
	Added Shortcode Help Page to give examples of how to use the shortcodes effectively.
	Added feed driven FAQs page - easier for me to update FAQs on the fly that way.
	Added several Filters and Hooks - will lay them all out in next revision.
	
3.1 to 3.5.0 were development versions.
3.0	Added New Shortcode [AMAZONPRODUCTS] (instead of [AMAZONPRODUCT=B0084IG8TM]) - old method will still work 
	Added Bulk API Call to limit number of calls to API (can use up to 10 ASINs at one time)
	Updated the depricated function calls
	Increased API return values for use in theme - puts all items in the array now
	Updated styles to include some new elements
	Updated database field for amazoncache table to allow for larger data size of cached XML body (as API can now return up to 10 itmes at a time)
	Updated aws_request function
	Wrapped generic helper functions in !function_exists wrapper to eliminate conflicts with some other Amazon plugins.
	Updated Install function with styles and database upgrade
	Added amazon icon button to editor to easily add shortcode.
	Added new parameters to shortcode to allow custom additions to any post/page:
		asin – this is the ASIN or ASINs up to 10 comma separated
		locale – this is the Amazon locale you want to get the product from, i.e., com, co.uk, fr, etc. default is your plugin setting
		desc – using 1 shows Amazon description (if available) and 0 hides it – default is 0.
		features – using 1 shows Amazon Features (if available) and 0 hides it  - default is 0.
		listprice – using 1 shows the list price and 0 hides it – default is 1.
		partner_id – allows you to add a different parent ID if different for other locale – default is ID in settings.
		private_key – allows you to add different private key for locale if different – default is private key in settings.
		public_key – allows you to add a different private key for locale if different – default is public key in settings.
	New Shortcode would be used like this:
		If you want to add a .com item and you have the same partner id, public key, private key and want the features showing:
		[AMAZONPRODUCTS asin="B0084IG8TM" features="1" locale="com"]
		If you want to add a .com item and you have a different partner id, public key, private key and want the description showing but features not showing:
		[AMAZONPRODUCTS asin="B0084IG8TM,B005LAIHPE" locale="com" public_key="AKIAJDRNJ6OU527HKGXQ" private_key="Nz3FYyeVysc5yjcZwrIV3bhDti/OGyRHEYOWO005" partner_id="wordseen-20"]
		If you just want to use your same locale but want 2 items with no list price and features showing:
		[AMAZONPRODUCTS asin="B0084IG8TM,B005LAIHPE" features="1" listprice="0"]
		If you just want 2 products with regular settings:
		[AMAZONPRODUCTS asin="B0084IG8TM,B005LAIHPE"]
		If you want to add text to a product:
		[AMAZONPRODUCTS asin="B0084IG8TM"]your text can go here![/AMAZONPRODUCTS]
